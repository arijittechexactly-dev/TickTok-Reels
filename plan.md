# TikTok-Style Video Feed App Plan

## Notes

- App must display an endless vertical scroll of short videos (like TikTok/Instagram Reels).
- There must be exactly 1,000 videos in the feed.
- Videos can appear in any order; no smart sorting needed.
- Single screen app: opens directly to the feed, no login, menus, or extra pages.
- UI should mimic familiar social video app experience (swipe up/down to scroll).
- Each video must be vertical (â‰ˆ9:16 aspect ratio), especially for the first 8 seconds.
- Only the first 8 seconds of each video must strictly meet criteria.

## Task List

- [x] Set up a new React Native project using React Native CLI
- [x] Design the main feed screen with vertical scrolling
- [x] Implement video player component for vertical (9:16) videos
- [x] Populate feed with 1,000 dummy video entries
- [x] Ensure endless scroll experience (pagination/virtualization)
- [x] Enforce video aspect ratio and 8-second criteria
- [ ] Polish UI for smooth, familiar social video experience
- [ ] Test app for performance and UX

## Current Goal

Polish UI for smooth, familiar social video experience and test app for performance/UX
